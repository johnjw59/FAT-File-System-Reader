# FAT12/32 File System Reader
This program reads a FAT12 or FAT32 file system dump and outputs the contents of said system. It was built as an assignment for CPSC313 at UBC in the 2014/15 Spring semester.

For the specific details and requirements of the project, check the `a4.pdf` file. The `fat12.dat` and `fat32.dat` files are the provided file system dumps, while `sample_output` contains the expected output we were to match.

*Note: as stated in `a4.pdf` we were provided with a basic framework of suggested files and methods. While the code and logic is mine, some of the structure of this project may not be.*
